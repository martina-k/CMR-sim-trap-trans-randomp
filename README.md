# CMR-sim-trap-trans-randomp
Simulation of CMR data with transcience, trap-dep and random recapture rates

Simulation using multi-state approach, to be analyzed using single-state-models

## First model:
Constant phi:s and p:s, but trying to include trap-dependence and transcience (by modelling ind as marked as juv and then becoming adults)

## Next steps:
-Time-variation in phi:s
-Random time effect on p:s (but same sigma2 for all states)
